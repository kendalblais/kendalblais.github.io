                        Not to be confused with the alien conspiracy crop circles, these are caused
                        by center-pivot irrigation where large machines irrigate large areas of land
                        by rotating around a pivot point. From above, they form large circles.

                        This is a sink hole that formed off the coast of Belize. Its 318m across and

                    <p>
                        These are window like structures on the sides of ships and submarines. Their
                        purpose is to let light in to the vessel and provide a means to look outside.
                        They are circular because the outsides of these vessels are put under a lot 
                        of stress. Building them circular provided a means to evenly distribute the forces
                        so that there were no corners that could crack or break under large pressure.

                        times. It revolutionized the transportation industry as a result of its 
                        circular shape.
